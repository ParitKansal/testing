### **What is Regression Testing?**
Regression testing is a type of software testing that ensures **existing functionality** still works after any changes, updates, or modifications are made to the system. Itâ€™s like a health checkup for the software, ensuring that new code does not break or negatively affect previously functioning features.

### **When to Do Regression Testing?**

1. **New Functionality Added**
2. **Bug Fixes**
3. **Code Optimization**

### **Process of Regression Testing (Short Points)**

1. **Code Changes**: Modify the code (e.g., new features, bug fixes, optimizations).
2. **Initial Test Failure**: Run existing test cases, and the program fails due to the changes.
3. **Debugging**: Identify and fix the bugs caused by the changes.
4. **Select Test Cases**: Choose relevant existing test cases to cover modified and affected areas of code.
5. **Add New Test Cases** (if needed): If new functionality is added, create new test cases.
6. **Execute Regression Tests**: Run the selected test cases to ensure nothing else is broken.
7. **Analyze Results**: If tests pass, the system is stable; if tests fail, debug and repeat.
8. **Final Verification**: Ensure the modified system works correctly with both old and new functionality.

### **Why Regression Testing is Necessary**

1. **Prevents Old Bugs from Reappearing**: Ensures that recent changes do not reintroduce previously fixed issues.
2. **Ensures Software Stability**: Verifies that new changes do not disrupt existing functionality, keeping the system stable.
3. **Validates New Functionality**: Confirms that new features work as intended without negatively impacting other areas.
4. **Maintains Compatibility**: Checks that the software remains compatible with other systems, components, and environments.
5. **Improves Cost-Efficiency**: Identifies issues early, reducing the cost and effort of fixing them at later stages. 

### **Techniques for the Selection of Test Cases for Regression Testing**

- **Select All Test Cases**: Comprehensive but inefficient.
- **Select Test Cases Randomly**: Quick but often ineffective, especially if the test cases have uneven fault detection capabilities.
- **Select Modification-Traversing Test Cases**: Efficient and targeted, but may miss indirect effects of changes.
- **Select Higher-Priority Test Cases**: Focused and resource-efficient, but could overlook less critical areas.

### **Smoke Testing** and **Sanity Testing**:

| **Aspect**               | **Smoke Testing**                                            | **Sanity Testing**                                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**            | A basic, preliminary test to check if the build is stable enough for further testing. | A focused test to check if a particular function or bug fix works as expected. |
| **Purpose**               | To verify that the critical functionalities of the application are working. | To validate that a specific change or function works after a build or bug fix. |
| **Scope**                 | Broad, covering major functionalities of the system. | Narrow, focusing on a specific part or feature. |
| **When to Perform**       | Performed early in the testing process, often on a new build. | Performed after smoke testing or when a fix has been applied. |
| **Test Coverage**         | Verifies if major components of the software are working. | Verifies whether a specific issue or functionality works correctly. |
| **Relation to Other Testing** | A subset of **Acceptance Testing**, verifying basic functionality for acceptance. | Part of **Regression Testing**, focused on verifying specific fixes or modifications. |
| **Performed By**          | Performed by **both developers and testers**. | Performed primarily by **testers**. |


| **Aspect**                       | **Static Slicing**                               | **Dynamic Slicing**                              |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**                    | Includes all statements that could affect the value of a variable at any point for any execution. | Includes only the statements that actually affect the value of a variable during a specific execution. |

| **Execution Consideration**       | Considers all possible executions of the program. | Considers only a particular execution path.      |
| **Cost**                          | Cheaper in terms of computation.                | More expensive due to actual execution tracking. |
