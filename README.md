### Different integration strategies

| **Integration Strategy**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                  | **Advantages**                                                                                                               | **Disadvantages**                                                                                                        | **Best For**                                                     |

| **Big Bang Integration (Nonincremental)** | All components are combined and tested as a whole after each unit has been tested individually.                                                                  | - Quick as it requires fewer initial setups<br> - No need for stubs or drivers                                               | - Difficult to isolate issues<br> - Errors are harder to trace<br> - Risky for large projects                             | Small, simple systems                                           |
| **Bottom-Up Integration**              | Testing begins with the lowest-level modules and progresses upward. Uses **test drivers** to simulate higher-level modules.                                       | - Good for performance-focused systems<br> - Easier to create drivers for lower-level modules<br> - Efficient for OOP        | - UI or main modules tested last<br> - May delay functionality testing                                                    | Object-oriented, real-time, performance-critical systems         |
| **Top-Down Integration**               | Testing starts with the top-level modules and progresses downward, using **stubs** to simulate lower-level modules.                                              | - Allows testing of main functionality early<br> - Detects design errors at higher levels sooner                             | - Stubs for lower-level modules can be complex<br> - Many stubs may be needed, increasing test setup time                 | Systems where top-level functionality needs early validation    |
| **Sandwich Testing**                   | Combines top-down and bottom-up approaches by focusing on a **target middle layer**. Simultaneous testing on top and bottom layers converges at the middle layer. | - Top and bottom layers can be tested in parallel<br> - Reduces need for excessive stubs and drivers                         | - Middle layer must be carefully chosen<br> - Less thorough testing of individual modules before integration              | Multi-layered systems requiring simultaneous top-down & bottom-up testing |
| **Modified Sandwich Testing Strategy** | Tests top, middle, and bottom layers in parallel, with targeted use of stubs and drivers. Middle layer tested independently, minimizing stubs and drivers.       | - Efficient parallel testing across layers<br> - Reduces stubs and drivers<br> - Facilitates focused testing on middle layer | - Complex setup as it combines both stubs and drivers<br> - Requires careful layer separation to avoid conflicts          | Systems with three clear layers and independent layer interactions |
