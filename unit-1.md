### Basics of Software Testing

1. **Quality Requirements**:  
   Industrial products are spot-checked to meet planned standards. Flawed products necessitate design or production changes.  

2. **Software is Intangible**:  
   Unlike physical products, software cannot be tested hands-on, making quality assessment challenging.  

3. **Faulty Software Issues**:  
   Unreliable software can cause financial loss, damage reputations, or pose safety risks, as in the case of malfunctioning autopilot systems.  

4. **Importance of Testing**:  
   Software testing ensures quality by identifying issues during development, reducing risks, and preventing failures or crashes. It is critical but complex.
